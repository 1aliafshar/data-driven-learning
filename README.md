## What is on Learn and what is on GitHub?
* On GitHub: example Notebooks, slides, extra material, exercises (in slides), public data sets for exercises
* On Learn: student manual, final assignments, overview of content per week, slides (duplicate), non-public data sets, uploading exercises

### Examples
For every week there is a Jupyter Notebook containing examples relating to the subjects of that week
* Week 1: understanding and exploring data
	+ [Data cleaning](examples/week-4/lesson-1/data_cleaning.ipynb)
	+ [Distributions](examples/week-4/lesson-1/distributions.ipynb)
	+ [Hypothesis testing](examples/week-4/lesson-2/hypothesis_testing.ipynb)
* Week 2: linear regression, logistic regression
	+ [Correlation](examples/week-5/lesson-1/correlation.ipynb)
	+ [Linear regression](examples/week-5/lesson-1/linear_regression.ipynb)
	+ [Evaluating regression](examples/week-5/lesson-1/evaluating_regression.ipynb)
* [Week 3: supervised machine learning](examples/examples-3.ipynb)
* [Week 4: unsupervised machine learning](examples/examples-4.ipynb)
* [Week 5: text mining and cross-validation](examples/examples-5.ipynb)

### Exercises
These are exercises you can make during the lesson to test your knowledge. You **don't** need to submit these with the final assignment. You can find the exercises in the slides.

These are PDF versions of the slides I give every week.

* [A more minimal cheatsheet](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/)
* [Datacamp Python basics](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/chapter-1-python-basics)

* [Markdown cheatsheet (for text in Notebooks)(https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) 

#### Mathematics
Using tools from data science and machine learning would not make a lot of sense without some understanding of mathematics and statistics. However, the focus of the course is on the application of data science, rather than the mathematical foundation. If I use formulas, I will not focus on the technical aspects, but explain what they do conceptually. If you need to catch up on math, you can use these links to the [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/):

* [Basic algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/introduction-to-algebra)
* [Equations and variables](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/one-variable-linear-equations)
* [Squares and roots](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/in-eighth-grade-math/squares-square-roots)
* [The coordinate plane and linear equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/two-var-linear-equations)
* [Exponents](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-exponents-radicals#pre-algebra-exponents) and [logarithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/exponential-and-logarithmic-functions/introduction-to-logarithms/a/intro-to-logarithms)
* [Basic probability theory](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/probability-geometry#probability-basics)

#### Data science and machine learning
* Good introduction: Machine learning is fun (https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471)

#### Tips
* Google, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/) are your friends. It’s not a shame to Google even really basic concepts.
* Your code should be properly commented (use `#`). Good commenting means you explain why you do something, not what you’re doing.
* Visualize and explore your data. Get acquainted with your data. Explore cases that deviate from the trend (outliers).
* Visualize your model predictions and [residuals](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/why-you-need-to-check-your-residual-plots-for-regression-analysis) to look for ways to improve your model. 
* Properly label your graphs and axes.
